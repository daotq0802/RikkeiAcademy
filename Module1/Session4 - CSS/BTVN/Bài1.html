    <p id="blue">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p><br>
    <p id="red">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements
        are
        positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background color are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes,
        and much more!</p><br>

        <b>Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
        children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings,
        paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something
        else)!
