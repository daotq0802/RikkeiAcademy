    <h3>5. Groups of selectors</h3><br>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors reprensents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several slectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separted list. White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.</p>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>CSS example: <br><br>
            In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br><br>
            h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br><br>
            is equivalent to: <br><br>
            h1, h2, h3 font-family: sans-serif <br>
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
